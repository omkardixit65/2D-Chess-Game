BASIC RULES:
  • White moves first, then players alternate turns
  • Click a piece to select it, then click a highlighted square to move
  • Green dots show available moves for the selected piece
  • If your king is in check, you must move it to safety
  • The game ends when a king is checkmated or conditions for a draw are met

PIECE MOVEMENTS:
  ♙ Pawn    - Moves forward 1 square (2 on first move), captures diagonally
  ♜ Rook    - Moves any distance horizontally or vertically
  ♞ Knight  - Moves in L-shape (2+1 squares), can jump over pieces
  ♝ Bishop  - Moves any distance diagonally
  ♛ Queen   - Moves any distance in any direction
  ♚ King    - Moves one square in any direction

SPECIAL MOVES:
  • Pawn Promotion: When a pawn reaches the opposite end, it becomes a Queen
  • Undo: Take back your last move (both yours and opponent's in bot mode)
